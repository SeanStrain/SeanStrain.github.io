Defend the Circle is an arcade shooter where the player has to survive an endless onslaught of opposing circles on an infinite canvas. The player can make use of power ups to aid in their survival as they watch the dynamic and colourful score counter tick upwards as high as they can get it, but the longer the game goes on, the larger the player grows, making the game harder and harder.

This was the first game I ever made. It was written in vanilla JavaScript with over 1400 lines of code.
